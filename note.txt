âœ… node-forge at both sides

# use node-forge at both sides	
# ReminderðŸš¨- when user generates RSA key pairs at client side, use synchrounous key generation. Cause keys are stored in state
 	variables and async key generation takes a little time which causes keys to be null. And when making a request, public key that is 
	to be sent to server will be null.
# ReminderðŸš¨- when using node-forge to perform RSA enc/dec processes, be careful to use "RSA-OAEP" scheme.
